// Set in JavaScript
// A Set is a built-in JavaScript object that stores unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references. It's similar to an array, but with some key differences that make it very useful for certain operations.

// Key Characteristics of Sets
// Unique Values: A Set can only contain unique values - no duplicates are allowed.

// Value Equality: Uses "same-value-zero" equality (similar to === but considers NaN equal to NaN).

// Order Preservation: Maintains insertion order of elements.

// Performance: Offers faster lookups than arrays for checking if a value exists.
