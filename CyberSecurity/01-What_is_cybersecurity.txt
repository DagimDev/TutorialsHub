A Simple Definition
At its core, cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

Think of it as the digital equivalent of home security. You have locks on your doors (passwords), a fence around your yard (firewall), and an alarm system (intrusion detection) to protect your physical belongings and family. Cybersecurity does the same for your digital assets.

1. Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, networks, and data from digital attacks. Its goal is to ensure information remains confidential, accurate, and available to authorized users only.
These attacks often aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information or interrupt normal business processes.


2. Malware

Malware stands for malicious software. It includes viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, ransomware, and adware.
They are designed to damage systems, steal data, or spy on users. Installing trusted antivirus software and keeping systems updated helps prevent malware infections.

3. Phishing

Phishing is a social engineering technique where attackers send fake emails or messages pretending to be trusted sources (like banks or companies).
Their goal is to trick users into revealing passwords, credit card numbers, or downloading malware.
Always check the sender address and avoid clicking suspicious links.

4. Firewall

A firewall acts like a security gate between your computer/network and the internet.
It filters traffic — allowing trusted data in and blocking suspicious activity.
There are hardware and software firewalls; both help control access to protect systems.

5. Encryption

Encryption converts readable data into unreadable code using algorithms and keys.
It ensures that even if someone intercepts the data, they cannot understand it without the correct key.
Used in secure messaging, HTTPS websites, and digital banking.

6. Decryption

Decryption is the reverse of encryption — converting encrypted data back to its original readable form using a secret key.
Authorized users or systems perform decryption to access the actual information.

7. Authentication

Authentication verifies who you are.
Examples include passwords, fingerprints, facial recognition, or one-time codes.
It’s the first step of securing systems before granting access to resources.

8. Authorization

After authentication, authorization decides what you can do.
For example, a regular user may view files but only an admin can edit or delete them.
Together, authentication and authorization ensure layered security.

9. Vulnerability

A vulnerability is a weakness in software, hardware, or processes that attackers can exploit.
Regular updates and security audits help find and fix vulnerabilities before hackers do.

10. Exploit

An exploit is the actual method or tool that attackers use to take advantage of a vulnerability.
For example, using a buffer overflow exploit to gain system access.

11. Threat Actor

A threat actor is anyone or anything that poses a security risk — from individuals to entire organizations.
Types include hackers, cybercriminals, hacktivists, insider threats, and nation-state actors.

12. Social Engineering

Social engineering is manipulating people into revealing confidential data.
Instead of attacking computers, hackers exploit human psychology.
Example: pretending to be tech support to get a password.

13. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)

A DDoS attack floods a target (like a website or server) with massive traffic from many sources, causing it to crash or become slow.
Companies use traffic filters and CDNs to defend against such attacks.

14. Patch Management

Patch management involves updating software regularly to fix security holes and bugs.
Hackers often exploit unpatched systems, so keeping software updated is crucial.

15. Zero-Day Attack

A zero-day attack happens when hackers exploit a vulnerability before the developer releases a patch.
Because no fix exists yet, it’s one of the most dangerous types of attacks.

16. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

An IDS monitors network or system activity for suspicious behavior and potential threats.
It alerts administrators when unusual activity is detected.
IDS can be host-based (HIDS) or network-based (NIDS).

17. Data Breach

A data breach happens when sensitive data (like passwords or credit card info) is accessed without authorization.
Causes include weak passwords, insider leaks, or malware.
Prevention includes encryption, monitoring, and strong access control.

18. Digital Footprint

A digital footprint is the trail of data you leave online — like posts, searches, or login activity.
It can be active (you post it) or passive (collected automatically).
Managing your footprint is key to protecting your privacy.
