A Simple Definition
At its core, cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

Think of it as the digital equivalent of home security. You have locks on your doors (passwords), a fence around your yard (firewall), and an alarm system (intrusion detection) to protect your physical belongings and family. Cybersecurity does the same for your digital assets.
