1. What Is Linux?

Explanation:
Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) based on the Unix architecture.
It manages your computer’s hardware and software — just like Windows or macOS — but it’s known for being secure, customizable, and free.

Key idea:
While Windows hides most system details from users, Linux gives you full control of the machine — perfect for developers, ethical hackers, and system admins.

Real-life example:
If you use an Android phone — you’re already using Linux! Android runs on a Linux kernel.

2. What Makes Linux Different?

Explanation:
Linux is open-source, meaning anyone can view, modify, or share its code.
This makes it highly secure, stable, and transparent.
It’s widely used in servers, cybersecurity, IoT devices, and programming.

Key differences from Windows:
| Feature       | Windows  | Linux               |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Cost          | Paid     | Free                |
| Source Code   | Closed   | Open                |
| Security      | Moderate | Very strong         |
| Customization | Limited  | Highly customizable |
| Command Line  | Optional | Core feature        |

3. Linux Architecture

Linux is made up of 4 main layers:

Kernel: The heart of Linux. Manages memory, CPU, and hardware communication.

System Libraries: Provide functions and system calls for applications.

System Utilities: Basic tools for system maintenance and operations.

User Space: Where users interact with the system through shells or GUI.

Example:
When you type a command like ls:

The shell sends it to the kernel

The kernel accesses the filesystem

It returns the list of files to your terminal

4. The Linux Kernel

Explanation:
The kernel is the core component of Linux. It controls:

Process management (CPU usage)

Memory management

Device drivers (keyboard, mouse, etc.)

System calls and security

Example:
If you open 5 programs, the kernel decides how much CPU and memory each gets.
That’s why Linux is stable even under heavy load — the kernel handles tasks efficiently.

Command Example:

uname -r


This shows your Linux kernel version.

5. Linux Distributions (Distros)

Explanation:
A distribution (distro) is a complete Linux package — kernel + software + tools — customized for different purposes.

Popular Linux Distros:

Ubuntu: Beginner-friendly (good for learners)

Kali Linux: Used for cybersecurity & penetration testing

Debian: Known for stability

Fedora: Focused on innovation

Arch Linux: For advanced users who want full control

CentOS / RHEL: Used in enterprise servers

Example:
If you’re learning ethical hacking — use Kali Linux.
If you’re learning programming — use Ubuntu.

6. Linux File System Structure

Explanation:
Linux organizes files in a tree structure, starting from the root directory /.
Everything — files, folders, even devices — is treated as a file.

Important directories:
| Directory | Description                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `/`       | Root directory (base of the system)    |
| `/home`   | User personal files                    |
| `/bin`    | Basic commands (like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) |
| `/etc`    | Configuration files                    |
| `/var`    | Variable files like logs               |
| `/usr`    | Installed software and utilities       |
| `/dev`    | Device files (USB, drives)             |
Example:

cd /home/dagim
ls


→ Navigates to your home folder and lists your personal files.
