1. What Is Linux?

Explanation:
Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) based on the Unix architecture.
It manages your computer’s hardware and software — just like Windows or macOS — but it’s known for being secure, customizable, and free.

Key idea:
While Windows hides most system details from users, Linux gives you full control of the machine — perfect for developers, ethical hackers, and system admins.

Real-life example:
If you use an Android phone — you’re already using Linux! Android runs on a Linux kernel.

2. What Makes Linux Different?

Explanation:
Linux is open-source, meaning anyone can view, modify, or share its code.
This makes it highly secure, stable, and transparent.
It’s widely used in servers, cybersecurity, IoT devices, and programming.

Key differences from Windows:
| Feature       | Windows  | Linux               |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Cost          | Paid     | Free                |
| Source Code   | Closed   | Open                |
| Security      | Moderate | Very strong         |
| Customization | Limited  | Highly customizable |
| Command Line  | Optional | Core feature        |
