1. What Is Linux?

Explanation:
Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) based on the Unix architecture.
It manages your computer’s hardware and software — just like Windows or macOS — but it’s known for being secure, customizable, and free.

Key idea:
While Windows hides most system details from users, Linux gives you full control of the machine — perfect for developers, ethical hackers, and system admins.

Real-life example:
If you use an Android phone — you’re already using Linux! Android runs on a Linux kernel.
