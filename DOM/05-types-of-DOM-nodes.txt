DOM node: In DOM terminology, all elements of an HTML document are nodes,
including the built-in DOM elements such as document document.body, HTML
tags such as <p> (called element node), a text in HTML tags (text node) and an
attribute (attribute node) of an HTML tag. DOM nodes are any one of the above
in an object form in the DOM hierarchy. Thus, node objects have methods in them
that we can use to access and alter them

Types of DOM Nodes
The DOM consists of different node types, including:

1. The “document node”: Document node is the root of DOM tree. It represents the
entire HTML document that is loaded in the browser window. It is the entry point to
the document. The document node has multiple methods that we can access all nodes
in the DOM tree. Also, the top-level nodes in an HTML document (<html>, <head>,
<body>) can be directly accessed using properties of document node as follows:
• document.documentElement to access the <html> tag
• document.head to access the <head> tag
• document.body to access the <body> tag
