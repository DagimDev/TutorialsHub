DOM node: In DOM terminology, all elements of an HTML document are nodes,
including the built-in DOM elements such as document document.body, HTML
tags such as <p> (called element node), a text in HTML tags (text node) and an
attribute (attribute node) of an HTML tag. DOM nodes are any one of the above
in an object form in the DOM hierarchy. Thus, node objects have methods in them
that we can use to access and alter them

Types of DOM Nodes
The DOM consists of different node types, including:
1. The “document node”: Document node is the root of DOM tree. It represents the
entire HTML document that is loaded in the browser window. It is the entry point to
the document. The document node has multiple methods that we can access all nodes
in the DOM tree. Also, the top-level nodes in an HTML document (<html>, <head>,
<body>) can be directly accessed using properties of document node as follows:
• document.documentElement to access the <html> tag
• document.head to access the <head> tag
• document.body to access the <body> tag

Element Nodes – HTML tags (<div>, <p>, <button>).

Dom element: DOM element on the other side is one type of a DOM node
representing only HTML elements. Meaning, an element node is a node that's
written using a tag in the HTML document. <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>,
<h2>, <p> are all elements because they are represented by tags. <!DOCTYPE >,
the comment and the text nodes are not DOM elements

3: The "attribute node”: Each attribute of an HTML element becomes element node
under the DOM tree. Once again, attribute nodes are also objects. Means they have
their own method that we can use to read or change the attribute values. Examples of
attribute node objects: <html lang="en-US">, <a href="">, <img src="" width=""
alt="">, <div id=""> <p style="">, etc. 

Attribute Nodes – Attributes like id, class, src (<img src="image.jpg">).

4. The "text node”: Text nodes represents the textual content in an element or an
attribute. Examples of text node objects include:
▪ <p> Some text </p>
Text Nodes – The text inside elements ("Hello World" inside <h1>).

Comment Nodes – HTML comments (<!-- This is a comment -->).
5. The "comment node”: HTML comments (<!-- comment -->) are represented by
comment nodes in a DOM tree. That means, comment node can also be accessed using
JavaScript. You may be asking yourself “why is a comment added to the DOM, if it
doesn’t affect the visual representation of an HTML?”. However, there is a rule under
DOM stating that anything in the HTML must be represented in the DOM tree.
Meaning, everything in HTML, even comments, become a part of the DOM.
