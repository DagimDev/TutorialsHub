DOM manipulation: introduction
• DOM manipulation with JavaScript:
▪ What do we mean by manipulating?
• Earlier we said that DOM represents the HTML page using a series of
objects, the document object being the main object. The document object
in turn houses other objects which also house their own objects, and so on.
• So, when we say, “DOM manipulation”, it simply means changing the
DOM (the HTML document). This in turn means, changing the HTML
elements, that DOM converted into objects, in response to a user’s action
▪ Manipulating DOM involves two steps:
• 1: Finding/selecting the element we want to work with
• 2: Altering the text or attributes of that element
▪ The “document object” makes manipulation of the HTML document
possible: The "document" object in JavaScript is the door to the DOM structure.
This is the name of the JavaScript object that contains all the methods and
properties to help us access and manipulate the DOM elements. The "document
object” allows us to access the root node of the DOM tree. You can access the
other child nodes of the DOM as properties of the “document object”.
• Example, to access the body node: console.log(document.body);
