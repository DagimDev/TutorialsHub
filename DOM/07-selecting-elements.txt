DOM manipulation: selecting elements (part 1)
• JavaScript is most used language to modify HTML elements or their content and apply
effects like show/hide, animations, etc. But before we perform any action on an element,
we need to select the target HTML element.
• What does selecting DOM elements mean? In terms of DOM manipulation, the term
“selecting” an element(s) means finding an element that we plan to manipulate or apply a
change on.
• Selecting in JavaScript can also be divided into three types
▪ 1. Select an individual element:
• Example: Finding one specific <div> element
▪ 2. Select multiple elements: Example:
• Finding all <div> elements
▪ 3. Traversing between multiple elements:
• Example: Finding a <p> element within a particular <div>
