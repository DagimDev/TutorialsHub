DOM manipulation: selecting an individual element (part 2)
• Selecting an individual element: There are three common methods provided by the
document object that we can use to select one specific element. Let’s look at them below.

▪ 1. getElementById() method: The getElementById method accepts CSS’ id
selector as its argument and returns an element whose id matches the passed
string/id. Since the ids of elements are always unique to that element, this is a faster
way to select an element. If the id is not found, then this method returns null.

2. querySelector() method: The querySelector method takes CSS selectors as its
argument and returns the first element that matches the passed selector. Meaning,
the method can take ids, classes and tag names as its argument.
• document.querySelector("#hi"); // selects the element with “hi” id name
• document.querySelector(".bye"); // selects all elements with “bye” class
name, but returns first element in the document with class name
• document.querySelector("div"); // selects all elements with “div” tag, but
returns first div
• document.querySelector("div span.hello"); // selects all “span” elements
within a “div” tag but returns the first span element with class name
"hello", inside a div
