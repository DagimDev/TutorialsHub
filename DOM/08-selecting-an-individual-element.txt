DOM manipulation: selecting an individual element (part 2)
• Selecting an individual element: There are three common methods provided by the
document object that we can use to select one specific element. Let’s look at them below.

▪ 1. getElementById() method: The getElementById method accepts CSS’ id
selector as its argument and returns an element whose id matches the passed
string/id. Since the ids of elements are always unique to that element, this is a faster
way to select an element. If the id is not found, then this method returns null.
