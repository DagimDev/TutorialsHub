Altering values (working with inline styling)
• Changing CSS Values with the DOM “style” property
▪ We use the style property to manipulate the inline style of the HTML elements
using JavaScript
▪ The style property is used to get as well as add the inline style of an element using
different CSS properties. We can set almost all the styles for the elements like
colors, fonts, text alignments, margin, borders, background images, sizes, and
more.
▪ The style property is extremely helpful to dynamically change the visual
representation of an HTML element using JavaScript. Note: the JavaScript syntax
for setting CSS properties is slightly different than CSS (Ex: backgroundColor
instead of background-color).
