■ Databases are usually controlled by a Database Management
    System (DBMS).
○ Functions of a DBMS:
■ Creation of a Database: DBMS helps in designing and creating
    databases as per defined schemas and structures.
■ Storage of Data/Information: It manages the storage of various
    types of data within the database.
■ Retrieval of Information: Enables users to efficiently retrieve
    specific data from the database using queries and commands.
■ Updating the Database: Allows for adding, modifying, or
    deleting data within the database.
■ Control of Redundancy and Inconsistency: Helps in
    minimizing data duplication and ensuring data consistency.
■ Efficient Memory Management: Optimizes the utilization of
    memory resources for data storage and retrieval.
    
■ Access Control and Security: Implement security measures to
    control access to the database and ensure data integrity.
    All in all, the comprehensive database system encompasses both the data,
    the Database Management System (DBMS), and their associated
    applications, collectively forming the foundational components referred to
    as a database system, often shortened to just Database.
