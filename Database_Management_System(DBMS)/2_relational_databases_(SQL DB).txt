Relational Databases (SQL DB)
○ Definition:
■ Relational databases, often referred to as SQL databases, are
    structured around multiple tables that interrelate with each other.
    The structure is akin to an organized set of spreadsheets where
    each table holds specific types of data. For instance, if you're
    dealing with an e-commerce platform, there might be a table for
    customers, another for orders, and so on. This structure allows
    for efficient management and retrieval of related data. A classic
    example of a relational database is MySQL.
○ Table Structure and Relationships:
■ Each table contains data specific to a particular domain or
    category, maintaining clear boundaries between different types of
    information.
■ Tables are intricately linked or related based on primary key
    and foreign key.
● A primary key is a unique identifier within a table, ensuring
    each record has a distinct value. It uniquely identifies each
    row and enforces data integrity by preventing duplicate or
    null values.
● A foreign key establishes a link between two tables,
    referencing the primary key of another table.
