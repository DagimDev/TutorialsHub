Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL DB)
○ Definition:
■ Non-relational databases, often termed NoSQL databases,
    diverge from the table-based structure. Instead, they primarily
    operate around objects or documents. There are no fixed table
    structures or rigid relationships between tables. One common
    format in NoSQL databases is the key-value pair model, similar
    to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). An example of a
    non-relational database is MongoDB.
○ Object-Oriented Approach:
■ NoSQL databases work with collections of objects rather than
    structured tables.
■ They typically adopt a more flexible schema, allowing for easier
    scalability and adaptability.


Why Use NoSQL?

NoSQL databases are designed for:
    Scalability (handle massive amounts of data)
    Flexibility (no fixed schema)
    Speed (optimized for specific data access patterns)
    Handling unstructured or semi-structured data (like JSON, text, images, logs)
    📌 Used widely in modern web apps, IoT, big data, and real-time analytics (e.g., Facebook, Netflix, 
    Amazon).

NoSQL (MongoDB) Example
{
  "_id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 21,
  "course": "Math"
}

8. Advantages of NoSQL

✅ High performance on large-scale data
✅ Flexible and easy to change schema
✅ Scales horizontally across servers
✅ Ideal for real-time analytics or content management
✅ Can handle unstructured data (like images, logs, or JSON)

⚠️ 9. Disadvantages of NoSQL

❌ Weaker consistency (eventual consistency model)
❌ Complex transactions are harder
❌ Different query languages (less standard)
❌ May require more data duplication
