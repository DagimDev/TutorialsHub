Relational vs. Non-Relational: Key Differences
○ Structural Variance:
■ Relational databases rely on tables with predefined structures and
    relationships.
■ Non-relational databases operate on flexible structures, using
    varied formats like key-value pairs or document-based storage.
○ Data Modeling Philosophy:
■ Relational databases follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency,
    Isolation, Durability) principles, ensuring strong data
    consistency.
■ Non-relational databases focus on BASE (Basically Available,
    Soft state, Eventually consistent) principles, emphasizing
    scalability and availability over strict consistency.
    Choosing the Right Fit
    The selection between relational and non-relational databases often hinges
    on the nature of the data and the requirements of the application. Relational
    databases excel in scenarios requiring structured data and complex queries,
    while non-relational databases offer scalability and flexibility for
    unstructured or evolving data models.
