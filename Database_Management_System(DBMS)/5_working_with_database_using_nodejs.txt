Working with Databases using NodeJS

GET Method: Retrieving Data
○ The GET method in Node.js allows the retrieval of data from a
    database. It's like browsing a library to find and read specific
    information without altering anything.
POST Method: Creating New Data
○ When using the POST method, Node.js can create new data in the
    database. It's akin to adding a new book to the library's collection.
    
PUT and PATCH Methods: Updating Existing Data
○ PUT Method: Complete Replacement
■ With PUT, Node.js updates existing data by completely replacing
    it with a new representation. Imagine swapping an entire book
    with a new edition in the library's catalog.
■ The client sends the entire updated data representation to the
    server.
○ PATCH Method: Partial Updates
■ The PATCH method updates data only if it exists and does so
    partially. It's like adding a new chapter to a book or modifying a
    section without rewriting the whole content.
■ Here, the client sends specific changes to be applied to the
    resource rather than the entire updated data.
