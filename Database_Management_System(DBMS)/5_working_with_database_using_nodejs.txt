Working with Databases using NodeJS

GET Method: Retrieving Data
○ The GET method in Node.js allows the retrieval of data from a
    database. It's like browsing a library to find and read specific
    information without altering anything.
POST Method: Creating New Data
○ When using the POST method, Node.js can create new data in the
    database. It's akin to adding a new book to the library's collection.
