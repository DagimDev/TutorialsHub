    various operations within a database.
SQL Statements: Managing Database Actions


CREATE: This SQL statement creates a new table within your
    database. It's like setting up the blueprint for a new section in your
    library to categorize books.
○ INSERT: When you use INSERT, you're adding new data to a table
    within your database. Think of it as placing a new book onto a shelf
    in your library.
○ SELECT: SELECT retrieves data from a table within your database.
    It's similar to browsing the library catalog to find specific books
    based on certain criteria.
○ UPDATE: UPDATE alters existing data in a table within your
    database. It's like correcting the details of a book's entry in the
    library catalog.
○ DELETE: DELETE removes data from a table within your
    database. It's akin to removing a book permanently from the library's
    collection
