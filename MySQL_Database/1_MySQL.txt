Node.js and MySQL: Powering Database Operations
    With Node.js, you can leverage SQL queries to interact with a MySQL
    database seamlessly. These SQL statements enable the execution of specific
    actions like creating tables, inserting data, retrieving information, updating
    existing records, and deleting entries. By integrating Node.js with MySQL,
    you gain a powerful toolset to manage your database efficiently within your
    applications.
