MySQL Overview: MySQL is a widely used Relational Database
    Management System (RDBMS). It's renowned for being free,
    open-source, and suitable for applications of various scales, ranging
    from small projects to large enterprise-level systems.

Node.js and MySQL: Powering Database Operations
    With Node.js, you can leverage SQL queries to interact with a MySQL
    database seamlessly. These SQL statements enable the execution of specific
    actions like creating tables, inserting data, retrieving information, updating
    existing records, and deleting entries. By integrating Node.js with MySQL,
    you gain a powerful toolset to manage your database efficiently within your
    applications.

    Working with databases using NodeJS: MySQL driver and
    connecting with MySQL database using Node
● MySQL Driver: Bridging MySQL with Node.js
○ A MySQL driver serves as a crucial intermediary, allowing seamless
    communication between a MySQL database and a Node.js
    application. Typically, developers rely on third-party modules
    installed via npm to establish this connection.
○ npm Module for MySQL: npm i mysql2
● Connecting to MySQL Database from Node.js
○ 1. MySQL Configuration:
■ In MySQL using phpMyAdmin, first create a database and set up
    user credentials (username and password)

2. Install and Import MySQL Module:
    ■ Use “npm install mysql2” to install the MySQL driver.
    ■ Import the MySQL module within your Node.js application.

3. Create a Connection:
■ Utilize the “createConnection” method provided by the MySQL
    module. Pass the database credentials (such as host, user,
    password, and database name) as an object

4. Connect to the Database:
■ Employ the “connect” method to establish the connection
    between your Node.js application and the MySQL database.
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
// STEP - 2 : Import mysql2 after installation
const mysql = require("mysql2");
// STEP - 3 : Pass Credentials to the createConnection method
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
host: "localhost",
user:
"Exact-Info-You-Used-When-Creating-The-User&DB",
password:
"Exact-Info-You-Used-When-Creating-The-User&DB",
database:
"Exact-Info-You-Used-When-Creating-The-User&DB",
});
// STEP - 4 : Connect to MySQL DB
connection.connect((err) => {
if (err) console.log(err);
else console.log("Connected to MySQL");
});
app.listen(3001, () => console.log("listening on port 3001"));


Creating Tables in a Database: Using SQL's CREATE Statement
    The “CREATE” statement in SQL is fundamental for establishing a new
    table within a database. It defines the table's structure, including its
    columns and their respective data types.
● CREATE Statement Syntax:
○ The syntax for creating a table using the “CREATE TABLE”
    statement involves specifying the table name, its columns, and their data types.
○ Syntax:
    ● CREATE TABLE table_name (
    ● column1 datatype,
    ● column2 datatype,
    ● column3 datatype,
    ● ...
    ●
    ● );
○ Example:
■ Suppose you're creating a table to store information about users
    in a database:
    CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
    );

Explanation:
    ● “CREATE TABLE” initiates the creation process of a newtable.
    ● “users” is the name of the table being created.
    ● Columns are defined within parentheses:
○ “user_id”: An integer column designated as the
    primary key and set to auto-increment for unique
    identification.
○ “username”: A column for storing usernames,
    restricted to 50 characters and cannot be empty (NOT
    NULL).
○ “email”: A column for storing email addresses, limited
    00 characters and ensuring uniqueness (UNIQUE).
