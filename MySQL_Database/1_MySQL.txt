MySQL Overview: MySQL is a widely used Relational Database
    Management System (RDBMS). It's renowned for being free,
    open-source, and suitable for applications of various scales, ranging
    from small projects to large enterprise-level systems.

Node.js and MySQL: Powering Database Operations
    With Node.js, you can leverage SQL queries to interact with a MySQL
    database seamlessly. These SQL statements enable the execution of specific
    actions like creating tables, inserting data, retrieving information, updating
    existing records, and deleting entries. By integrating Node.js with MySQL,
    you gain a powerful toolset to manage your database efficiently within your
    applications.

    Working with databases using NodeJS: MySQL driver and
    connecting with MySQL database using Node
● MySQL Driver: Bridging MySQL with Node.js
○ A MySQL driver serves as a crucial intermediary, allowing seamless
    communication between a MySQL database and a Node.js
    application. Typically, developers rely on third-party modules
    installed via npm to establish this connection.
○ npm Module for MySQL: npm i mysql2
● Connecting to MySQL Database from Node.js
○ 1. MySQL Configuration:
■ In MySQL using phpMyAdmin, first create a database and set up
    user credentials (username and password)

2. Install and Import MySQL Module:
    ■ Use “npm install mysql2” to install the MySQL driver.
    ■ Import the MySQL module within your Node.js application.

3. Create a Connection:
■ Utilize the “createConnection” method provided by the MySQL
    module. Pass the database credentials (such as host, user,
    password, and database name) as an object
