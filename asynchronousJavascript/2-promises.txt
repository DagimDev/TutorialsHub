2. Promises
● Promises are the foundation of asynchronous programming in modern JavaScript.
    ● A promise is an object returned by an asynchronous function, which represents the
    current state of the operation.
    ● At the time the promise is returned to the caller, the operation often isn't finished, but the
    promise object provides methods to handle the eventual success or failure of the
    operation.
● A promise is a special kind of object in JavaScript that has 3 possible states:
    ○ Pending: It's the initial state, and it signifies that the corresponding task is yet to
    be resolved.
    ○ Fulfilled: Means the task has been completed successfully.
    ○ Rejected: Means the task has produced some kind of error.
