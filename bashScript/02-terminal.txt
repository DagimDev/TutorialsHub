Terminal: GUIs, allow a user to accomplish daily tasks by easily interacting with
windows and icons. However, there are commands that need to be manually
entered via texts to instruct the computer directly. We usually do this through
terminals. Terminals, also known as command lines or consoles the “black” screen
programmers use to send text commands to do things like navigate through a folder
or copy a file and do more complex tasks.
