Shell: When you type commands on your terminal, what youâ€™ve typed must be
understood before the computer executes the task. Shell is the software that
interprets the commands typed on terminal so that your computer understands them
and return a response to your command. There are different shells
(programs/CLI/script) that we can use to manipulate our OS. Example: Bash (for
Mac and Linus OS), Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell.
