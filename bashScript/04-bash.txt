Bash: It is an acronym for Bourne Again SHell which is a command-line interface
(CLI) and is currently the most widely used shell.
● Bash is a type of shell (CLI) that we can use to communicate/instruct our
    OS. Meaning, we use Bash when we want to control our OS without
    having to navigate menus, options, and windows within a GUI
● Whatever we can do with our mouse to communicate with our OS, we can
    do it with from our terminal by running Bash commands without the need
    to use our mouse to navigate through our computer
