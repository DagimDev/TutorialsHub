The main Bash commands 
File & Directory Operations
● Directory: when we discuss Bash commands, we will use the term “directory” more often.
    Please know that directory is another name for folder.
▪ pwd: It prints full path of your current/working directory
cd: It will change the directory you are currently in so that you can manipulate the
    different files and directories in your system. It is basically going to a different
    folder and double clicking 
ls: Lists contents of the current directory, whether files or folders. It’s the same as
    opening a folder in file explorer to see its contents 
mkdir: Makes/creates a new directory. It is the same as you right clicking and
    creating a folder
touch: This is going to be the easiest way to create a new file in a current
    directory. It is the same as right clicking on a folder and creating a new file
mv: It moves or renames directory.
Example: mv style.css CSS. This command will move the style.css file
    found in your current directory to the CSS folder
● Example: mv style.css custom.css. This comand will rename the file
    style.css to custom.css It is the same as right clicking on style.css to
    rename it 
rm	Delete file	rm file.txt (use -r for folders)
rm and rmdir: Both remove directories. However, rmdir will only delete empty
    directories, whereas rm will remove directories that may contain content such as
    files and subdirectories.
• rmdir can only remove empty directories
• rm removes both files and non-empty directories.
• rm -r removes both the directory and the file within it.
• rm -r -rf removes recursively and forcefully all files in that directory and
    the directory itself.
• Example: rm -r CSS will removes the CSS folder (this folder will not be
    removed by rm unless it has files or folders in it)
• Example: rmdir CSS will remove the CSS folder, if it has not files or
    folders in it. 
cp	Copy file/folder	cp file.txt backup/

File Content & Editing
echo:
● Using echo without option: It prints text to the terminal window.
Example: echo “hello world” prints “hello world” on terminal
● Using echo with fie name only: It creates a file. Example: echo >
    style.css creates the style.css file
● Using echo with text and file name: creates the file and writes the text
    in the file. Example: echo "Hello" > index.html, creates an index.html
    file and types “Hello” on the file
cat	View file	cat script.js
nano	Text editor	nano file.txt (Ctrl+X to exit)
