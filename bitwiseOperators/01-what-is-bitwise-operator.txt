1. What Are Bitwise Operators?
Bitwise operators perform operations on the individual bits (0s and 1s) of integer numbers. They are used for:

Low-level optimizations (faster than arithmetic operations)

Memory-efficient data storage (flags, permissions)

Cryptography & compression algorithms

Hardware programming (embedded systems)

2. How Numbers Are Stored in Binary
Before using bitwise operators, you must understand:

Computers store numbers in binary (base-2).

Each digit is called a bit (0 or 1).

Example: 5 in binary is 0101 (4 bits).

Binary Representation of Common Numbers
Decimal	Binary (4-bit)
0   0000
1   0001
2   0010
3   0011
4   0100
5   0101
6   0110
7   0111
8   1000
