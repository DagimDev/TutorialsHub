3. The 7 Bitwise Operators in JavaScript

Operator	    Name	                Example	What It Does

&	            AND	a & b	            Sets bit to 1 only if both bits are 1

`	            `	OR	`a	b`	        Sets bit to 1 if either bit is 1

^	            XOR	a ^ b	            Sets bit to 1 if bits are different

~	            NOT	~a	                Flips all bits (1→0, 0→1)

<<	            Left Shift	            a << b	Shifts bits left, fills with 0

>>	            Right Shift	            a >> b	Shifts right, preserves sign bit

>>>	            Unsigned Shift	        a >>> b	Shifts right, fills with 0
