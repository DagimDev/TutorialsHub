CSS Positioning
Controls element placement:

static – default, normal flow

relative – relative to itself

absolute – relative to nearest positioned ancestor

fixed – relative to viewport

sticky – toggles between relative and fixed based on scroll

Example:
<style>
    

div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
</style>
