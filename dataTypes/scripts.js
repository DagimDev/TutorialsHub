// What is data structure and why do we need to structure data?
//  • Data structure: It is a particular way of storing, organizing and processing
// data/information in a computer so that it can be retrieved and used most productively.
//  ▪ The concept of data types is important in programming. That is why learning
// programing language starts by understanding what data is and how it is structured
// for effective use. To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know
// something about the data type.
//  ▪ Data structures are the building blocks of algorithms and computer programs. It is
// a key topic when it comes to Software Engineering interview questions. Hence as
// developers, we must have good knowledge about data structures

// Data structure types: There are two types of data structure available for the programming
// purpose, primitive data structure and non-primitive data structure.
