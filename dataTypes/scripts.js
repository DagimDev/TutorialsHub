// What is data structure and why do we need to structure data?
//  • Data structure: It is a particular way of storing, organizing and processing
// data/information in a computer so that it can be retrieved and used most productively.
//  ▪ The concept of data types is important in programming. That is why learning
// programing language starts by understanding what data is and how it is structured
// for effective use. To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know
// something about the data type.
//  ▪ Data structures are the building blocks of algorithms and computer programs. It is
// a key topic when it comes to Software Engineering interview questions. Hence as
// developers, we must have good knowledge about data structures

// Data structure types: There are two types of data structure available for the programming
// purpose, primitive data structure and non-primitive data structure. 



// Primitive data structure (data types) in JavaScript: These data structures are the ones
// that are predefined by almost all programing languages. Whether it is JavaScript, Python
// or any other programing language, they know what these data types are. They know what
// to do with them. Ex: If you tell a programing language to add two integer values, it knows
// what to do with the integers. Primitive data types include:
// ▪ Number/integer: which stores a range on mathematical integers
// ▪ String: Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form.
// Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes.
// ▪ Boolean: stores logical values that are either true or false.
// ▪ Undefined: The undefined datatype, whose value is undefined is used to denote
// an absence of a meaningful value. Do you remember when we said the datatype of
// a variable that has no value assigned is 'undefined', that is what we mean by
// undefined data type.
// ▪ Symbol: was introduced in ECMAScript 2015, so just a few years ago. It's a very
// peculiar data type. Once you create a symbol, its value is kept private and for
// internal use. Symbol can be created using the factory function Symbol () which 
// returns a Symbol. Every time you call the factory function, a new and unique
// symbol is created.
// ▪ Null: JavaScript defines that null is an empty object value. Null represents the
// intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values
// and is treated as falsy for Boolean operations.
// ▪ BigInt: Bigint value represent integers with arbitrary precision. provides a way to
// represent whole numbers larger than 253
// -1. So, it means, with BigInts, you can
// safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for
// Numbers.



// Non-primitive data structure: These are structures created by grouping primitive data
// together. Non-primitive data structure is a type of data structure that can store the data of
// more than one type. The way they are grouped together varies depending on the kind of
// task we are trying to accomplish

// Linear data structures: If the non-primitive data are grouped in a sequential
// order, they are called Linear. Example:
// • Array: An array stores a collection of items in a manner that the position
// of each element can be calculated or retrieved easily by an index.
// • Stack: A stack stores a collection of items in the linear order that
// operations are applied. This structure is named as “stack” because it
// resembles a real-world stack — a stack of plates.
// • Queue: A queue stores a collection of items like a stack; however, the
// operation order can only be first in, first out. This structure is named as
// “queue” because it resembles a real-world queue — people waiting in a
// queue.
// • Linked List: A linked list stores a collection of items in a linear/sequential
// order. Hence, you must access data sequentially and random access is not
// possible.

// Nonlinear data structure: If the non-primitive data aren’t grouped in a sequential
// order, they are called Nonlinear. Example:
// • Tree: A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized
// hierarchically and are linked together.
// • Graph: A graph stores a collection of items in a nonlinear fashion. Graphs
// are made up vertices, and lines that connect them, also known as edges.
// These are useful for representing real-world systems such as computer
// networks.
// • Hash table: A hash table, also known as a hash map, stores a collection of
// items in an associative array that plots keys to values. A hash table uses a
// hash function to convert an index into an array of buckets that contain the
// desired data item.
