// What is data structure and why do we need to structure data?
//  • Data structure: It is a particular way of storing, organizing and processing
// data/information in a computer so that it can be retrieved and used most productively.
//  ▪ The concept of data types is important in programming. That is why learning
// programing language starts by understanding what data is and how it is structured
// for effective use. To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know
// something about the data type.
//  ▪ Data structures are the building blocks of algorithms and computer programs. It is
// a key topic when it comes to Software Engineering interview questions. Hence as
// developers, we must have good knowledge about data structures

// Data structure types: There are two types of data structure available for the programming
// purpose, primitive data structure and non-primitive data structure. 



// Primitive data structure (data types) in JavaScript: These data structures are the ones
// that are predefined by almost all programing languages. Whether it is JavaScript, Python
// or any other programing language, they know what these data types are. They know what
// to do with them. Ex: If you tell a programing language to add two integer values, it knows
// what to do with the integers. Primitive data types include:
// ▪ Number/integer: which stores a range on mathematical integers
// ▪ String: Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form.
// Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes.
// ▪ Boolean: stores logical values that are either true or false.
// ▪ Undefined: The undefined datatype, whose value is undefined is used to denote
// an absence of a meaningful value. Do you remember when we said the datatype of
// a variable that has no value assigned is 'undefined', that is what we mean by
// undefined data type.
// ▪ Symbol: was introduced in ECMAScript 2015, so just a few years ago. It's a very
// peculiar data type. Once you create a symbol, its value is kept private and for
// internal use. Symbol can be created using the factory function Symbol () which 
// returns a Symbol. Every time you call the factory function, a new and unique
// symbol is created.
// ▪ Null: JavaScript defines that null is an empty object value. Null represents the
// intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values
// and is treated as falsy for Boolean operations.
// ▪ BigInt: Bigint value represent integers with arbitrary precision. provides a way to
// represent whole numbers larger than 253
// -1. So, it means, with BigInts, you can
// safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for
// Numbers.



// Non-primitive data structure: These are structures created by grouping primitive data
// together. Non-primitive data structure is a type of data structure that can store the data of
// more than one type. The way they are grouped together varies depending on the kind of
// task we are trying to accomplish
