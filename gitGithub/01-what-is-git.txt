What is Git?
▪ Git is a Version Control System. There are multiple Version Control Systems, but
    Git is by far and large the most popular.
▪ In simple terms, Git is a software that tracks the changes you make to files, to be
    specific, it tracks the changes you make in your code. By tracking it is meant that
    Git will record every change you make in a file and saves the different versions of
    the file. If you want to look at a specific version of your file, you can go back and
    see that version. 
Git’s tracking of file changes is important when a project is done in collaboration
    with others by allowing changes made by different people to be merged into one
    document.
