The. git directory and how does Git track changes?
▪ The .git directory: This the directory/folder where Git stores the information about
    your project. Without the .git directory, your project is a local project and not a Git
    project. Meaning, you cannot perform any git commands and the project remains
    untracked for any changes. The .git directory does the following:
● Remote information (to which remote server your project is connected)
● History of all local commits
● Branch information (on which branch is your current project state (HEAD) pointing to)
● All logs of all local commits you have ever made (including revert changes)
▪ Where does the. git directory come from?
● In case of new projects, this directory is created when you open your new
    project folder in terminal and type the command “git init”
● If it is an existing project, this directory is created when you bring a copy
    of a repository into your local computer through the command “git clone”.
