Why use Git in website/application development process?
▪ As stated above, Git is useful to anyone who writes code and tracks changes made
    to a file. Git simplifies the process of working with other people. Having a
    centrally located place (remote place such as GitHub) where you can upload your
    changes and download changes from other members of your team, enable you to
    collaborate more easily with other developers.
▪ If different people are working on the same file, Git can automatically merge the
    changes from each contributor, without losing everyone's work.
