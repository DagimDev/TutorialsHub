Why use Git in website/application development process?
▪ As stated above, Git is useful to anyone who writes code and tracks changes made
    to a file. Git simplifies the process of working with other people. Having a
    centrally located place (remote place such as GitHub) where you can upload your
    changes and download changes from other members of your team, enable you to
    collaborate more easily with other developers.
▪ If different people are working on the same file, Git can automatically merge the
    changes from each contributor, without losing everyone's work.
Diffing: makes git supper powerful and efficient
● Diff (or short for difference): Diff in computation world allows
    programmers to look at 2 files side by side and see what differentiates them
    by spotting the place where a new line of code had been added.
● Diffing is used mostly when comparing two different versions of the same
    e/code, meaning comparing an older with the newer version.
● Diffing is used in Git to specifically show what has changed between two
    versions of the same file/code/commits/branches
