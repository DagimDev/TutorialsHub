What is GitHub?
▪ Git is software that runs locally. Your files and their history are stored on your
    computer. However, if you want to work on a project together with others from
    anywhere, you will need to store a copy of your files in a clude/remote place. That
    is when GitHub comes in handy.
▪ GitHub is a website/online host where you can remotely store your git
    project/repositories so that they are accessible from anywhere in the world for
    anyone working on the project. It offers the distributed version control and source
    code management functionality of Git, plus its own features
