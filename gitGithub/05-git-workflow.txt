Git workflow: It is a guideline for how to use Git in a team project to ensure the team is
    on the same page. Even if there is no fixed standard way of interacting with Git, however,
    a software team must at least know where to begin when implementing Git in the
    workplace. No matter what, the teamâ€™s size and culture are always considered when
    planning a Git workflow.
