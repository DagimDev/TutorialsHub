What happens in Git workflow?
▪ Creating a repository: Someone needs to create the central repository on GitHub
    if the project is a brand-new project. Here are the steps to create a new repository
    on GitHub:
Cloning: If it is not a brand-new project and there exists a Git repository already,
    each developer needs to create a local copy of the existing repository, a process
    called cloning. Here is the command you use to clone a remote repository:
● Go to any folder of your choice on your computer where you want to store
    the remote repository and open your terminal
● Type: git clone <URL address of the central repo>
o You can find the address of the central repo by going to your
    GitHub first and opening the repository. Click on “Code” green
    button and either copy the HTTPS or SSH URL
