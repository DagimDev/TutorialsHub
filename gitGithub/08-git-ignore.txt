Ignoring a file: just type name of the file to ignore in the
.gitignore file. Example: todo.t

Ignoring a folder/directory: To ignore entire directories,
just by including their paths and putting a forward slash (
/ ) at the end. Example: node_modules/

Ignoring in group using Wildcard (*):
● Example: *.log ignores any file ending with the
.log extension

Negation (!): Putting negation before the file name
negates a file that would be ignored otherwise
● Example: !example.log, this means that
example.log is not ignored, even though all other
files ending with .log are ignored already

Comments: Any lines that start with # are comments.
Example: # macOS Files
o Note: Once you added a file/folder in your .gitignore file, all your
Git repositories will ignore the files and folders listed in the
.gitignore file.
