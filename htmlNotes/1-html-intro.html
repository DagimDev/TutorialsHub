  <p>1. HTML Overview
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the core language used to create webpages. It structures content using a    system of elements and tags. Each HTML file is a text file with a .html extension. Web browsers read HTML files    and render the visual content accordingly. HTML elements are represented by tags such as <html>, <head>, and   <body>. The goal of HTML is to describe what each part of the webpage means and how it should be interpreted by   the browser.</p>
