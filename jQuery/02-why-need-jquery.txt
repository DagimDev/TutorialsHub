What can you do with jQuery? jQuery is JavaScript and does not add anything to the
JavaScript language itself. Whatever you do with vanilla JavaScript, you can do it with jQuery
too. But jQuery does the following jobs in a very easy way for developers:
• DOM manipulation:
▪ Selecting: jQuery provides simpler and CSS-like way of selecting HTML
    elements
▪ Updating: Multiple jQuery methods provide different ways to update, animate
    and loop through elements in a much simpler way
• Handling events: Allows you to bind events with elements without the need to write
    a fall back for older versions
• Effects and animations: jQuery also allows us to add animated effects on our web
    pae which takes a lot of pain and lines of code with JavaScript.

Simplicity: The main reason we need jQuery is because it makes JavaScript easier when
    we use it on website, in fact, jQuery’s motto is "write less, do more". How?
▪ jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of vanilla JavaScript
    code to accomplish and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single
    line of code.
