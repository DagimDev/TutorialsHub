Selecting elements with jQuery (id, class, element selectors)
• jQuery selectors: They select HTML elements based on their name, id, classes, types,
    ttributes, values of attributes and much more.
▪ jQuery selectors mostly use the existing CSS Selectors and, in some instances,
    stom selectors.
▪ jQuery() vs $(): All jQuery selectors use a function called jQuery(). However,
    there is a shorthand representation of the jQuery() method, just using the dollar
    sign at the start and add parentheses like this: $().
• Therefore, jQuery() is the same as $()
• Note 1: The jQuery function/ jQuery() always returns a jQuery object (that
    is based on an array). You will see this in example when jQuery selectors
    are explained
• Note 2: Please note that jQuery() returns an object even if there are no
    elements that matches the selector. If the jQuery object contains no
    elements, it will simply do nothing. 

jQuery #id Selector: jQuery #id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML tag to find the
specific element. Let’s use the following HTML to explain id, class and element selectors
in jQuery

jQuery .class Selector: jQuery .class selector finds elements with a specific class.
