Selecting elements with jQuery (id, class, element selectors)
• jQuery selectors: They select HTML elements based on their name, id, classes, types,
    ttributes, values of attributes and much more.
▪ jQuery selectors mostly use the existing CSS Selectors and, in some instances,
    stom selectors.
▪ jQuery() vs $(): All jQuery selectors use a function called jQuery(). However,
    there is a shorthand representation of the jQuery() method, just using the dollar
    sign at the start and add parentheses like this: $().
• Therefore, jQuery() is the same as $()
• Note 1: The jQuery function/ jQuery() always returns a jQuery object (that
    is based on an array). You will see this in example when jQuery selectors
    are explained
• Note 2: Please note that jQuery() returns an object even if there are no
    elements that matches the selector. If the jQuery object contains no
    elements, it will simply do nothing.
