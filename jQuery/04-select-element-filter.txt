Selecting elements with jQuery (filters)
â€¢ jQuery (filters): jQuery provides several filter methods to narrow down the search for
elements in a DOM tree

first(): The first() method filters the set of matched elements and returns the first
element of the specified elements. Example: The script below will select all <li>s
and filters the first <li> only and change its background color to pink
$("li").first().css("background-color", "pink");
