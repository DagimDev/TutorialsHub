Selecting elements with jQuery (filters)
• jQuery (filters): jQuery provides several filter methods to narrow down the search for
elements in a DOM tree

first(): The first() method filters the set of matched elements and returns the first
element of the specified elements. Example: The script below will select all <li>s
and filters the first <li> only and change its background color to pink
$("li").first().css("background-color", "pink");

last(): This method returns the last element of the specified elements. Example:
The script below will select all <li>s and filters the last<li> only and change its
background color to pink
$("li").last().css("background-color", "pink");

even() and odd() : These method filter the set of matched/selected elements and
returns those with an even/odd index number. Example: Let’s select all <li>s and
make background color of those <li>s with even index green and make background
color of those <li>s with odd index purple
$("li").even().css("background-color", "green");
$("li").odd().css("background-color", "purple");

nth-child() or nth-children(): This method selects all elements that are the nth
child/children, of their parent. Note: The element type is not considered here, if it
is the nth child, this method returns that element. Example: Let’s select a <ul> that
has <li>s as children and change the background color of the 2nd child <li> only
$("ul li:nth-child(2)").css("background-color", "lightgreen");
