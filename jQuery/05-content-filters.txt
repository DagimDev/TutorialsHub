• has(selector): This method filters the set of matched elements and returns
    only those elements that has the specified descendant element. Note: To
    select elements that have multiple elements inside of them, use comma.
    Example: Let’s select a <div> that has <p> in it, and change this <div>’s
    background color
    $("div").has("p").css("background-color", "pink");
