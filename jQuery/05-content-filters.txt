Content filters
• has(selector): This method filters the set of matched elements and returns
    only those elements that has the specified descendant element. Note: To
    select elements that have multiple elements inside of them, use comma.
    Example: Let’s select a <div> that has <p> in it, and change this <div>’s
    background color
    $("div").has("p").css("background-color", "pink");

:contains(text): This selector selects all elements containing the specified
    string. Note: The string can be contained directly in the element as text, or
    in a child element. Example: Now, let’s select a <ul> that has “First list
    item” as text directly in it or in its children.
    $("ul:contains(First list item)").css("backgroundcolor", "pink");
