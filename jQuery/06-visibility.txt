hidden(): This method hides the selected elements just like CSS property
    display: none. Example: let’s hide our <ul> that has id name of firstUL
    $(" ul[id=firstUL] ").hide();

visible(): The method selects every element that is currently visible. If an
    element is already invisible (using ways like display: none,
    type="hidden”), the visible() method will not apply to it. Example: Let’s
    select any <ul> that is visible and change its background color
    $("ul:visible").css("background-color",
    "lightgreen");

show(): The method shows the hidden, selected elements. Note: The
    show() shows hidden with jQuery methods and display: none in CSS, it
    will not show if element is hidden using CSS property display: none.
    Example: Now, let’s show a <ul> that ha is hidden, if there is any
    $(" ul").show();
