Updating content:
▪ html(): This method sets/returns the content of selected elements (including
    HTML markup). Example: Let’s print in the console the text, including our <li>
    tag, of our <li> that has a specific class name
    console.log($("li[class=otherLi]").html());

text(): The method sets/returns the text content of selected elements. Example:
    Let’s print in the console the text of our <li> that has a specific class name
    console.log($("li[class=firstLi]").text());

remove() and empty(): The remove() method removes the selected element and
    all its child elements. The empty() method removes only the child elements of the
    selected element, meaning, the selected element itself will not be removed, but its
    child/children. This method sets/returns the value of form fields
Example: Let’s remove our <div> and its child <p>s first and then go to emptying our <div>’s
children. Notice: We styled our <div> to show that it won’t be affected by empty()
    method.
    <div style="border:1px solid; height:100px">I
    am a parent div
    <p>I am first</p>
    <p>I am second</p>
    <p>I am third</p>
    </div>
    $("div").remove();// removes our parent <div>
    with child <p>
    $("div").empty();// removes only the child <p>
