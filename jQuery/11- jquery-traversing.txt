Finding elements (jQuery traversing): We have seen previously that traversing
the DOM means moving through DOM/HTML elements to find/select them based
on their relation to other elements. jQuery has its own traversing methods to select
HTML elements based on ancestor, child, sibling and other related elements.

jQuery traversing: Methods to up the DOM
• parent(): returns the direct parent element of the selected element
o Example: Let’s style our <div> using its child <ul> and applying
    the parent() method
    <div>
    <p>I am div's child</p>
    <ul>
    <li>UL is my dad. Div is my granddad</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    $(document).ready(function () {
    $("ul").parent().css({ border: "2px solid red" })});


parents(): returns all ancestor elements of the selected element
    o Example: Let’s style all ancestor elements of our <li>
    <div>
    <ul>
    <li>ul and div are my ancestors. </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    $("li").parents().css({ border: "2px solid red" });
