To handle events in jQuery, just like any other method in jQuery, you start by selecting the
element you want to respond to. We said that selection of elements in jQuery creates a
jQuery object. It is on these objects that we apply the different jQuery event methods.
jQuery has various methods to attach a handler function to an event for selected elements.

jQuery’s on() method
    ▪ The on() method is used to handle various kinds of events on selected elements
    ▪ Syntax: $(selector).on(event, childSelector, data, function, map)
    ▪ Note: Event handlers attached using the on() method will work for both current

    handlers. Meaning, it does the following things:
    ▪ Bind any event triggered on the selected elements to an event handler

UI/DOM element events: focus, blur, change

    blur event occurs. Blur event occurs when an element loses focus.
