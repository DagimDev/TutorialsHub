To handle events in jQuery, just like any other method in jQuery, you start by selecting the
element you want to respond to. We said that selection of elements in jQuery creates a
jQuery object. It is on these objects that we apply the different jQuery event methods.
jQuery has various methods to attach a handler function to an event for selected elements.
