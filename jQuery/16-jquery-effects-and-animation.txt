Effects and animations in jQuery
    • One of the advantages of jQuery is, it lets us easily enhance our web pages by adding some transition and movement effects
    ▪ Some of the popular jQuery effects: hide(), show(), toggle()

toggle(): The toggle() method is used to check the visibility of selected
    elements to toggle between hide() and show() for the selected elements.
    Note: We can pass speed in milliseconds for the toggle effects. In the
    following example paragraph element will take 2000 milliseconds time to
    get hidden and displayed completely

Some of jQuery’s sliding effects: slideUp(), slideDown(),
    slideToggle()
    • slideUp(): It is a method that slides-up (gradually hides) the selected
    elements

slideDown(): This method slides (gradually hides) an element down. 

slideToggle(): This method toggles between the slideDown and slideUp
methods. Meaning, if the element(s) has been slid down already,
slideToggle() will slide it/them down and vice versa. We can basically
avoid the use of slideUp() and slideDown() and just use slideToggle().

fadeOut(): This method gradually changes the opacity, for selected
elements, from visible to hidden (fading effect).
