▪ Key board events: These events fire when a user interacts with a keyboard

keydown event: This event fires when user first presses any key on the keyboard. Note: If
the user holds down the key, this event fires repeatedly.

keyup event: This event fires when a user releases any key on the keyboard

keypress event: Just like keydown event, this event fires when a user presses any key on
the keyboard. However, the pressing of key results in printing a character on the screen.
The keypress event will not fire for enter, tab or arrow keys as pressing them will not result
in printing characters on the screen, but the keydown event will fire if a user presses these
keys.
• Note: The keydown and keypress events fire before a character appears on the screen, the
keyup fires after it shows.

 Keydown / Keyup Event
Example:

javascript
document.getElementById('myInput').addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
    console.log(`Key pressed: ${e.key}`);
});

Mouseover / Mouseout Event
Example:

document.getElementById('hoverElement').addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
    console.log('Mouse over element!');
});
