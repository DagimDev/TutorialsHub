▪ Mouse events: These events fire when the mouse moves, or the user clicks a button. All the
elements of the page support these events.

Click event: This event fires when the user presses on and releases the primary mouse
button (usually the left button).
o Note 1: This event also fires if the user presses the “Enter” key on the keyboard
when an element has focus.
o Note 2: For touchscreen devises, a tap on the screen acts like a single left-click
o Note 3: We can add the above two events to any element, but it’s better to apply it
only on the items that are usually clicked (like button element)

   o Note: For touchscreen devises, a double-tap on the screen acts like a double leftclick.
   o Note 2: We can add the above two events to any element, but it’s better to apply it
   only on the items that are usually clicked (like button element)
