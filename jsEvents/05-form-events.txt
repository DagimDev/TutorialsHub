Form Events: These events are common while using forms on a webpage. We find the submit
event mostly in form of validation (Ex: if a user misses a required information or enters an incorrect
input, submit event fires to check the form values before the data is sent/submitted to the server).

change event: This event occurs when the value of an element has been changed. Example,
the change event fires when the checked value in check box, or radio button changes 
When form element value changes (input, select, etc.)

submit event: This event fires when a user submits a form. The change occurs on the
<form> element when user submits a form using a button or a key.

cut event: This event fires when a user cuts a content from any HTML element.
    o Note: The cut event is mostly used on <input> elements with type="text"
    o Note 2: Although the cut event is supported by all HTML elements, it is not
    possible to cut the content of a <p> element, unless we add the “contenteditable”
    attribute and give it a value of "true".

paste event: This event fires when a user pastes content in an element
    o Note 1: The paste event is mostly used on <input> elements with type="text"
    o Note 2: Although the paste event is supported by all HTML elements, it is not
    possible to cut the content of a <p> element, unless we add the “contenteditable”
    attribute and give it a value of "true"

copy event: This event happens when a user copies the content of an element (ex: copying
    content from a form field)
    o Tip: The copy event is mostly used on <input> elements with type="text".

select event: This event fires when a user selects some text in an element.
    o Note: The onselect event is mostly used on <input type="text"> or <textarea>
    elements.
