Form Events: These events are common while using forms on a webpage. We find the submit
event mostly in form of validation (Ex: if a user misses a required information or enters an incorrect
input, submit event fires to check the form values before the data is sent/submitted to the server).

change event: This event occurs when the value of an element has been changed. Example,
the change event fires when the checked value in check box, or radio button changes 
When form element value changes (input, select, etc.)

submit event: This event fires when a user submits a form. The change occurs on the
<form> element when user submits a form using a button or a key.
