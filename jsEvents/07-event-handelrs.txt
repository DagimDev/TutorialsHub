Event handling in HTML

Event handling: is a mechanism that controls these events and decides what should happen when an event
happens.
• Event handlers/listeners:
▪ An event handler is also known as an event listener. An event handler/listener is a specific script
(JavaScript code) that gets executed when a particular event (such as clicking of a button) happens
on an HTML element.
▪ An event handler is a script/function that listens to the event and responds accordingly to the event.
▪ Note 1: An event listener/handler is a function with a name if is we want to reuse it for various
events.
▪ Note 2: An event listener/handler is an anonymous function if it is going to be used only once.
▪ Note 3: An event can be handled by one or multiple event handlers. If an event has multiple event
handlers, all the event handlers will be executed when the event is fired. For example, if there are
multiple scripts that will be executed when a button is clicked, all the scripts/functions will be
executed when the button is clicked.

Event binding: The event binding allows you to add an event handler (JavaScript function) for a specified
event so that your chosen JavaScript function will be executed when that event is triggered.
