HTML event handlers attribute: HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML
elements. To handle events using this method, all you need to do is to use an HTML attribute with the name of the
event handler function.
Syntax: onclick="changeBackground()"
▪ Example 1: Let’s try to show an alert text on browser that says, "button clicked!!" when a user
clicks on a button
• Our code in the JavaScript file:
function showClickedAlert() {
alert("button clicked!!");
}
• Attaching the event handler function when there is a click event on our <button>
element:
<button onclick="showClickedAlert()">Save</button>
▪ Example 2: Let’s try to change the color of our button’s text to red when the <button> is clicked
• Our code in the JavaScript file:
function changeButtonColor() {
var myButton = document.getElementById("buttonId");
myButton.style.color = "red";
}
• Attaching the event handler function to when there is a click event on our <button>
element:
<button id="buttonId"
onclick="changeButtonColor()">Change Color</button>

Note: This approach (using inline event handlers) is considered a bad practice for the following
reasons:
• The event handler code is mixed with the HTML code, which will make the code more
difficult to maintain, especially on a larger scale it can get quite messy. Look at this
example:
<button onclick="changeButtonColor()"
ondblclick="showClickedAlert()"
onfocus="changeBackgroundColor()" >Change Color</button>
o Look how unclean it will be to have all these event handlers in our <button>
• The approach won’t allow us bind more than one event handler for an event. Meaning, if
we use the inline event handling approach, we cannot assign a text color changer function
and a background color changer function for a single <button> click event.
• In inline HTML event handling, the scope of the event handler functions cannot be
controlled. This approach requires the event to be global, meaning, the event handler
functions need to be globally accessible
• If the element is loaded fully before the JavaScript code, users can start interacting with
the element on the webpage which will cause an error. To use the above
showClickedAlert() function, if the HTML page is loaded fully and the JavaScript has not
been loaded, the showClickedAlert () function is undefined. Meaning, if a user clicks the
button at this moment, an error will occur.

• Priority order: If the same event, that had an event handler attribute within the HTML, is
assigned DOM level event handler in the external JavaScript file, the event handler
assigned in the HTML will be replaced by DOM level event handler. Let’s assume we have
an event handler attribute that changes the text color of a <button> to red when it is clicked.
We also have a DOM level event handler that changes the text color of the same <button>
to green when it is clicked.
var myButton = document.getElementById("buttonId");
//function changing button text to green
function changeTextToGreen() {
myButton.style.color = "green";
}
//function changing button text to red
function changeTextTored() {
myButton.style.color = "red";
}
// Attribute event handler (for the <button> click
event)
<button id="buttonId" onclick="changeButtonColor()"
ondblclick="showClickedAlert()">Change Color</button>
// DOM level event handler (for the <button> click
event)
myButton.onclick = changeTextToGreen;
o The <button> text color will change to green, not red, when clicked as the event
handler in the external JavaScript gets priority over the attribute handler
