Ways to bind an event (DOM level 2 event handlers/listeners)
    • DOM level 2 event handlers/listeners: Under this event handling approach, we will add/remove the event
handler as a listener for an element using the addEventListener() method.
    ▪ This is the most favored way of handling events as the approach allows adding (removing) of
multiple event handlers for a single event using the event listener methods.
    • DOM Level 2 Event Handlers provide two main methods to register/deregister event listeners:
    ▪ addEventListener(): registers an event handler
    ▪ removeEventListener(): removes an event handler
    • Syntax:
    ▪ element.addEventListener(event, function)
    ▪ element. removeEventListener(event, function)
