## 🎯 What is Middleware?

- Middleware (also called hooks) are functions that run at specific points in a document's lifecycle. Think of them as automatic actions that happen before or after certain operations.

- Simple Analogy:

* Imagine you're baking a cake:
* Pre-bake hook: Preheat the oven, grease the pan (things you do BEFORE baking)
* Post-bake hook: Let it cool, add frosting (things you do AFTER baking)
* The operation: Actually baking the cake
