3. ðŸ§± Composition vs Inheritance
Inheritance uses extends, but sometimes it's better to use composition (i.e., "has-a" instead of "is-a").

Composition means combining smaller parts (objects) to build more complex ones.

class Engine {
  start() {
    console.log("Engine started");
  }
}

class Car {
  constructor() {
    this.engine = new Engine(); // Composition
  }

  drive() {
    this.engine.start();
    console.log("Car is moving");
  }
}
