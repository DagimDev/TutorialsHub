JavaScript Object Shorthand Syntax
    JavaScript provides several handy shorthand notations for working with objects that can make your code cleaner and more concise. Here are the most useful ones:
1. Property Value Shorthand (ES6+)
When the property name matches the variable name:

// Long way
const name = 'John';
    const age = 30;
    const user = {
        name: name,
        age: age
    };

// Shorthand
const user = { name, age };
