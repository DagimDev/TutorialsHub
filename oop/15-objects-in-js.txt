Objects in JavaScript: In JavaScript everything (including array) is an object except for
    the primitive data types (Boolean, number and string, and undefined). Thus, if you master
    objects in JavaScript, think as if you mastered a lot.

Ways to initialize/create an object in JS : There are different ways to create
    an object in JavaScript
▪ Initializing an object literal: The object literal initializes the object with curly
    brackets. Example: const objectLiteral = {};
● Note: Creating an object using object literal method is very limiting
    because it creates only one object at a time.
     let myPerson= {
        name: “Abebe”,
        Age: 13
     };

Initializing object constructor function with new object: The object
    constructor initializes the object with the new keyword. Constructor function is
    the blueprint that creates a new object and set values for any existing object
    properties.. Unlike object literal, constructor function allows us to create as many
    objects (of similar type) as we want. 

Example: let objectConstuctor = new Object();

    ● Note: To separate a regular function from an object constructor function,
        we always have to use uppercase when giving it a name.
    ● Note: In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a
        substitute for the new object. The value of this will become the new
        object when a new object is created.
    ● Note: Below, function Person() is an object constructor function that we
        can use to create objects of the same type by calling the constructor
    function with the new keyword.

     function Person (name, age) {
        this.name = name,
        this.age = age
     }

// Creating 2 objects using the same constructor above
    const myPerson = new Person (“Hana”, 43);
    const herPerson = new Person (“Kibrom”, 43);
    ● The “this” keyword in JS: the keyword has different meanings in JavaScript:
    o In object constructor function: “this” refers to the future object
        that will be created with the constructor. In the above example, if
        you console.log(this) within the constructor function, it will print
        the two objects (myPerson and herPerson)
    o Alone or when in a function: “this” refers to the global Object
    o In events: “this” refers to the element receiving the event
