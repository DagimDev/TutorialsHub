Objects in JavaScript: In JavaScript everything (including array) is an object except for
    the primitive data types (Boolean, number and string, and undefined). Thus, if you master
    objects in JavaScript, think as if you mastered a lot.

Ways to initialize/create an object in JS : There are different ways to create
    an object in JavaScript
▪ Initializing an object literal: The object literal initializes the object with curly
    brackets. Example: const objectLiteral = {};
● Note: Creating an object using object literal method is very limiting
    because it creates only one object at a time.
     let myPerson= {
        name: “Abebe”,
        Age: 13
     };
