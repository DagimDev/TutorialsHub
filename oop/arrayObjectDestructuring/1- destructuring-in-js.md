Destructuring in JavaScript: It is a JavaScript feature that allows us to extract multiple
    pieces of data from an array or object and assign them to their own variables.
    Destructuring was introduced in ES6
Destructuring explained with real life example: To illustrate destructuring, it is
    easier to understand the analogy of how we make a sandwich from items in our
    fridge. If you want to make a sandwich, there is no need to take out everything
    you have in the fridge. You only take out the items you would like to use on your
    sandwich, such as cheese, vegetables and choice of your meat. Destructuring is
    exactly the same. We may have an array or object that we are working with, but
    we only need some of the items contained in these. Destructuring makes it easy
    to extract only what is needed.
