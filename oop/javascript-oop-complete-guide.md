Four Pillars of OOP
1. Data Encapsulation
Definition: Wrapping data and methods within an object, exposing only selected information

Purpose: Protective shield preventing external code from accessing internal data directly

Implementation: Using private properties/methods and public interfaces

2. Data Abstraction
Definition: Exposing only essential characteristics while hiding implementation details

Purpose: Simplify complex systems by showing only relevant features

Example: Using high-level public methods accessible across classes

3. Data Polymorphism
Definition: Ability of objects to take different forms (from Greek: "poly" = many, "morphism" = forms)

Types:

Compile-time: Method overloading

Runtime: Method overriding

Example: Shape class with circle, square, rectangle subclasses

4. Data Inheritance
Definition: Child classes inheriting properties and methods from parent classes

Benefits: Code reusability, hierarchical organization
