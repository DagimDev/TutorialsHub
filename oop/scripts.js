// Object oriented programming in JavaScript

// Example to describe a Car using the object-oriented data model
    // ▪ Object: Let’sa assume we have a “car” object
    // ▪ Properties of the object: model, make, color, doors
    // ▪ Methods/Actions: Car Starts (startCar), Car Accelerates (accelerate), Car
// Decelerates (decelerate)
    // ▪ Events: enter a> startCar, up arrow > accelerate, down arrow > decelerate
    // • Note: At this point, the computer would have some understanding of what
// a car is. It still doesn't know everything about a car. For example, it doesn't
// know it has windows or tire 

// Object literal syntax: var object-name = {key1: value1, key2: value2};
// o Example:
let person = {
firstName: 'Abebe',
lastName: 'Kebede',
someFunction: function () {
return this.firstName;
}
};
// o FirstName, lastName and someFunction are the properties of
// person object
// o Abebe, Kebede and function () {return this.firstName;} are
// property values
