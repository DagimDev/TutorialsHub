1. Machine Code (Binary)
What: Direct CPU instructions in binary (1s/0s)

Level: Lowest (hardware-level)

Example: 10110000 01100001 (x86 mov instruction)

Characteristics:

No translation needed

Processor-specific

Extremely fast

Human-unreadable

2. Assembly Language
What: Human-readable machine code with mnemonics

Level: Low-level

Example (x86):

asm
MOV AL, 61h       ; Load 61h into AL register
ADD AX, BX        ; Add BX to AX
Characteristics:

1:1 with machine code

Requires assembler

Hardware-dependent

Used in firmware/OS kernels

3. High-Level Compiled Languages
What: Human-readable code â†’ compiled to machine code

Level: High-level

Examples: C, C++, Go, Rust
