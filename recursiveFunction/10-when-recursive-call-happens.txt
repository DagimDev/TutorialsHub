In Most Recursive Functions:
Yes — the recursive call is usually done first, and the other operations (like *, +, pushing to array, etc.) happen afterward when the function returns.

This is called a post-order approach: first recurse, then compute.

Example: Factorial (Post-Order)

function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 1;              // base case
  return n * factorial(n - 1);        // recursive call happens first
}
Call stack builds → then results multiply on the way back.
