Execution Order in Merge Sort: mergeSort vs merge
In your Merge Sort implementation, the functions execute in this order:

1. mergeSort Executes First (Recursively)
The mergeSort function runs first and keeps calling itself recursively until it hits the base case (arrays with 0 or 1 elements).

Only after all recursive splits are done does the merge function start executing.

2. merge Executes After Splitting is Complete
The merge function runs after the deepest recursive mergeSort calls return.

It combines the sorted subarrays back together.

Step-by-Step Execution Flow
Let's see how this works with your example array [-6, 20, 8, -2, 4]:

Phase 1: mergeSort Splits the Array (Top-Down)
First Call:
mergeSort([-6, 20, 8, -2, 4])
→ Splits into left = [-6, 20], right = [8, -2, 4]

Recursive Call on Left:
mergeSort([-6, 20])
→ Splits into left = [-6], right = [20] (base case reached)

Recursive Call on Right:
mergeSort([8, -2, 4])
→ Splits into left = [8], right = [-2, 4]
→ Then mergeSort([-2, 4]) splits into left = [-2], right = [4] (base cases)

Phase 2: merge Combines Subarrays (Bottom-Up)
Now, the recursion "unwinds," and merge starts executing:

First Merge:
merge([-6], [20]) → Returns [-6, 20]

Second Merge:
merge([-2], [4]) → Returns [-2, 4]

Third Merge:
merge([8], [-2, 4]) → Returns [-2, 4, 8]

Final Merge:
merge([-6, 20], [-2, 4, 8]) → Returns [-6, -2, 4, 8, 20]

Key Takeaways
mergeSort runs first (recursively splitting the array).

merge runs after (combining the split arrays in sorted order).

Execution is depth-first:

The algorithm fully splits the left side before processing the right side.

Merging happens from the smallest subarrays up to the full array.
