What Does "Winding" and "Unwinding" Mean in Recursion?

These terms describe the two phases of recursive execution:

ðŸ”„ Winding Phase (Recursive Descent)

This is the phase where recursive calls are made, but not yet resolved.

Each time the function calls itself, it pushes a new frame onto the call stack.

The parameters change slightly with each call, moving the function toward the base case.

No actual computation is completed during winding if the work is after the recursive call.

ðŸ§  Think of this like diving into a tunnel, deeper and deeper, until you hit a wall (the base case).

Example:

function countDown(n) {
  if (n === 0) return;
  countDown(n - 1); // Recursive call
  console.log(n);   // Work happens later
}

Winding Stack:

countDown(5)
countDown(4)
countDown(3)
countDown(2)
countDown(1)
countDown(0)  <-- base case hit, recursion stops

At this point, no console.log has run yet.
