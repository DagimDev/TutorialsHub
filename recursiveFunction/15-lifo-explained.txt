LIFO stands for Last-In, First-Out, and it's a rule that describes how items are added and removed from certain data structures like the call stack.

📦 What Does “Last-In, First-Out” Mean?
The last item that was added to the stack is the first one to come out.

You push items onto the top, and you pop from the top.

Real-World Analogy: Stack of Plates
Imagine a stack of plates:

You put plate 1 on the table.

Then plate 2 goes on top.

Then plate 3 goes on top of that.

To remove a plate, you always take the top one first:

Remove plate 3 (last in → first out)

Then plate 2

Then plate 1
