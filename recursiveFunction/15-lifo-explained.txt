LIFO stands for Last-In, First-Out, and it's a rule that describes how items are added and removed from certain data structures like the call stack.

📦 What Does “Last-In, First-Out” Mean?
The last item that was added to the stack is the first one to come out.

You push items onto the top, and you pop from the top.
