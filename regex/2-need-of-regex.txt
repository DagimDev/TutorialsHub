Why Do We Need Regex?
Definition 1: Regex solves several critical problems in text processing:

Pattern Matching: Find complex patterns that simple string searches can't handle

    Example: Find all email addresses in a document

Validation: Check if input follows a specific format

    Example: Validate phone numbers, passwords, or dates

Text Manipulation: Find and replace patterns in bulk

    Example: Reformat dates from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD

Data Extraction: Pull specific information from unstructured text

    Example: Extract all product codes from logs

Efficiency: Perform complex text operations with concise expressions

Definition 2: Having the ability to search through text, validate text, and replace text using an advanced set of rules is exactly what Regex is for 

    Ex: Use case scenario
      Let's say you have a form which collects users data including their phone number. Users provide their numbers following different formats. These could be some of the formats to use. 
        1234567890
        (123) 456-7890
        (123)456-7890
        123 456 7890
        123.456.7890 

      What you want to do is, regardless of the format the user followed, you want to check if it is a valid US number. How do you achieve this programmatically?  

      These are the kind of scenarios where you need help from Regular Expression.
