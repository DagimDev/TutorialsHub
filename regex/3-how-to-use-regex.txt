 How do we use RegEx?
  ********************
 
    Basics 
    ******* 

      To use RegEx, we need three things. 
        - The first one is the text that we do the search on.
        - The second is the pattern that we use to search 
        - The third one, a way to do the matching/searching 
      
        For ex: 
          Example text: "Abebe beso belto tegna. Keza 911 dewele!" 

          Question: What is the number that abebe called?
            - To identify the number, we need to come up with some kind of pattern that uniquely identify the number 911 from the Example text. 

              - The pattern we write should match only with the number 911.

              - First thing we need to write is the matching pattern.
